    <p>Result:</p>
    <p>My first audience was a DES 157 student last year and she had seen the Game of thrones TV show.</p>
    <p>During silence testing, she successfully figure out all my pathways and overviewed all my functional pages. She suggested me adding more elements in "Map", and delete the no-need "instruction" button on both "Map" and "Book" page.</p>
    <p>My second audience was TA Spencer, he was more focus on the technical result instead of my content or design</p>
    <p>He suggested me to set a max view point of the camera in "Map" and fix a typo in the first page alert.</p>
