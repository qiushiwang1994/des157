				<p> Evaluate The User Interface of Farfetch.com</p>

				<p>I choose to evaluate the farfetch website (www.farfetch.com) not only because it is my often using website, but also it contains numerous of categories, and I really want to see how the website manages them.</p>
				<p>Farfetch is an online shopping website, the target user includes women, men and kids all over the world, over 100 countries are available to choose, and multiple kinds of currency are available to pay.</p>
				<p>The user interface of farfetch.com is clear and effective. Very fast opening and downloading speed, no need to wait when opening the website. Present only necessary information on the main page.</p>
				<p>The navigation is visible and make it easy to go back and home page. Different categories have their own name and no misunderstanding.</p>

				<h2>Fourth Post</h2>
				<time datetime="2017-01-11">Jan 11th, 2017</time>

				<p> blog for Studio 4</p>

				<p>I started with reading the requirement and planned to use Taylar Swift's alum to apply the set time function and the radio function.</p>
				<p>I downloaded four Taylay Swift's album pictures first. And added a hover on the picture.</p>
				<p>I next downloaded four music from each album and added the audios to html. And then I applied set time function onto each picture.</p>
				<p>The audio, the hover and the time set are all functional right now. But I am not happy with the size adjustment.</p>

				<h2>Fifth Post</h2>
				<time datetime="2017-03-01">March 1st, 2017</time>

				<p> blog for Studio 5</p>

				<p>Libary three.js using learing steps:</p>
				<p>I started with leaning tutrial on youtube.com. I took the tutorial of leaning hot to use three.js, how to do mesh in blender, and how to export the mesh from blender to three.js.</p>
				<p>The thing to remember is choose the geometry instead of buffergeometry, or there will be a spinning wheel.</p>
				<p>The thing need to be fixed: A simple mesh can be export now, but need to figure out how to export 3D character.</p>
